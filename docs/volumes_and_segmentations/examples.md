# Examples

Here are a few examples of how cross-scale microscopy data can be explored using Mol\*VS. If you are not familiar with Mol\* Viewer, it will take you a bit of time to get your brearings, so we hope that these examples will help you on your journey.

## Across experiments and scales ##
[San Martin et al.](https://www.cell.com/structure/fulltext/S0969-2126(01)00642-6) conducted extensive cryo-EM imaging and refined 3D reconstruction of a large bacteriophage by fitting a crystalographic model of P3, the major protein forming the capsid of this bacteriophage, into the cryo-EM data. They were then able to infer potential interactions between the capsid protein and an underlying membrane holding the genomic material of this bacteriophage, as well as to derive a model of this bacteriophage at quasi-atomic resolution. 

**With Mol\*VS, wou can now examine the outcomes of these experiments interactively in the web browser and conduct further examinations of your own.** Access a [pre-made visualization state of the bacteriophage](https://molstar.org/viewer/?snapshot-url=https%3A%2F%2Fmolstarvolseg.ncbr.muni.cz%2Fsnapshots%2Femd-1014.molj&snapshot-url-type=molj&prefer-webgl1=1).
